Tabula Rogerina
Map of the known world by created in the Arab empires by geographer Muhammad al-Idrisi in 1154. The map is based on al-Idrisi's travels during his life around the world. As you can see, this version is upside down because the original had north oriented on the bottom. This version is later recreation (made in 1300 or 1486) with the map oriented with north at the top.
